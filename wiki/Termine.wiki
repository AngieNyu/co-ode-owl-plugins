#summary Populate your ontology using text extraction

= Termine plugin =

== Description ==
The Protégé TerMine plugin uses text mining tools to extract candidate terms from a corpus of text and provides an interface for rapidly bringing these terms into an OWL ontology. It currently uses the [http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/ TerMine] term extraction tool provided by NaCTeM to extract concepts from text. The plugin accesses TerMine via a Web Service over the Internet.
