#summary Spreadsheet-style views for your ontology

= Matrix Views =

== Description ==
Several spreadsheet-style views of an ontology, including existential fillers, individual relationships and an object properties view.

== Features ==

  * Navigate by fully functioning class/property tree
  * Add/remove columns to customize
  * Comma-separate values in a list for quick editing
  * Drag and drop properties on the matrices to add columns
  * Drag and drop classes on the matrices to add fillers, domains and ranges
  * Filter annotation columns by language (to allow translation-style view)

== The plugins ==

=== Tabs menu ===

Two default tab layouts are provided:

  * Matrix
  * Property Matrix

=== Views menu ===

All of the matrices are implemented as views so you can add them into your own custom tabs:

==== Class Views ====
===== Class annotations =====
===== Class existentials (asserted and inferred hierarchies) =====

For highly compositional ontologies a lot of time can be saved by using the *Class Existential Matrix* to add multiple superclass restrictions on classes.

If the column is *some p* and the row is *ClassA* and the cell contains an entry *ClassB* then the following axiom exists in the ontology:

  * if ClassB is plain (can be edited) this means *subClassOf(ClassA, p some ClassB)*
  * if ClassB is *bold* (not affected by editing) this means *equivalentClass(ClassA, X and (p some ClassB))*
  * if ClassB is (bracketed) (not affected by editing) this means *subClassOf(AncestorA, p some ClassB)* ie that it is inherited

Multiple values in cells are separated by commas and each value is a filler for a separate sub/equivalent class restriction.

  * Add property columns to the matrix, either by *drag and drop* or using the toolbar *add object property column to matrix*
  * Some cells may already contain values. There can be several fillers in one cell.  Neither of these is affected by editing. Normal entries are editable.
  * Edit/add values by (double) clicking in a cell. If the property is functional and has a very narrow range specified then a dropdown will appear. In most cases a text editor will be available. Multiple values can be entered by comma separating them.

==== Individual Views ====
===== Class membership =====
===== Individual relationships =====

==== Object Property Views ====
===== Object property features =====

== Quick Start ==

=== Translation ===

To aid multilingual label generation for entities, all matrix views allow filtering by language.
To set up a view as below, follow these steps:

  # Enable one of the matrix tabs or add a matrix view to a current tab
  # Press the top left button on the menu bar *Add annotation column to matrix*. A dialog will appear.
  # Select the annotation URI in which you will create your labels
  # Select a language you will be adding labels for
  # Press OK
  # If you want to provide multiple translations or compare against an existing translation repeat from step 2, but select a different language
  # Open up your hierarchy and select the first cell you wish to edit
  # When entered, return drops to the next entity and you can start typing immediately
