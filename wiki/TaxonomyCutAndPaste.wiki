== Description ==
Sometimes, all you need is a quick extract of a part of your hierarchy for a paper or presentation.
These 2 very simple views provide a quick way to extract parts of your hierarchy into text form.

A small tutorial shows how these views were created.

=== Tabbed Subclasses view ===
Shows a tab-indented list of your asserted class hierarchy from the currently selected class

=== Decendant Names view ===
Does the same without indentation. Just cut and paste into your favourite applications.
